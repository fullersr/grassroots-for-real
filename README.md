# grassroots-for-real

This project was conceived in February, 2017 and posted here mid-April, 2017. It begins by laying out the essential aspects of an effective grass roots ecosystem and by defining the digital infrastructure that might support that.

As it proceeds, it will define the components in greater detail, and specify the architecture and API's for a portal and for inter-organizational collaboration.

If the stars align properly, it will assemble existing software and/or develop new capabilities to constitute a reference implementation.
