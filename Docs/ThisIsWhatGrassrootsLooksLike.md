## Introduction <a name = "introduction" />
Events over the course of the last decade, and most dramatically 6 months, have shown just how vulnerable our political process has become. Principles we thought reliable are shifting under our feet and melting away like polar ice. Institutions we relied on to support economic stability, education, workers' rights, and environmental protection are perverted or dysfunctional. In short, national and often state governments tend to work against the interests of the people. And many people feel isolated and/or under siege. Generally things seem out of whack.

 Right now people are energized. They want to do something to promote their vision of a just society. It is obvious that neither of the two parties is capable of nurturing this kind of energy. In fact, they've fairly often proved themselves more a source of disillusionment.

And while the issue-focused national and state efforts such as ACLU and Planned Parenthood are important allies, they are not by themselves sufficient. The issues demanding engagement are too varied for any single group. More importantly they do not provide the necessary forum to organize and coordinate local responses.

Many are turning to coordinated volunteer groups such as those founded on the Indivisible Guide, and those inspired by Michael Moore's 5 things. These new efforts in fact continue the pattern of grassroots response modeled by Black Lives Matter among others.

But these most recent efforts lack much coordination and coherence.  Energy is dissipated by bad scheduling and contradictory messaging. How can they be sustainable unless they can effectively channel their energy.

What we need is a networked model for grassroots organizing, one that provides a sense of community, that collaborates with other similar organizations, that nurtures leadership and gives the individual the means to focus on issues which matter to her most according to her availability and skill set.
