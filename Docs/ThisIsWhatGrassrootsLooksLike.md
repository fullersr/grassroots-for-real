## Introduction <a name = "introduction" />
Events over the course of the last decade, and most dramatically over the last year, have shown just how vulnerable our political process has become. Principles we thought reliable are shifting under our feet and melting away like polar ice. Institutions we relied on to support economic stability, education, workers' rights, and environmental protection are perverted or dysfunctional. In short, national and often state governements tend to work against the interests of the people.

The typical response takes one of several forms:  to promote the political party of choice, to canvas and get out the vote, to mobilize in demonstrations against the outrage du jour, or to sign the petition, and give money, to the young man or woman with the clipboard who is knocking at your door and appealing to save the \[ _fill in the worthy cause_ \]. None of these is sufficient to put things back in order.

For one thing, these solutions often involve top-down structures. By that we mean, they tend to operate at the state and national level and to that extent are by definition no longer grassroots.  They often operate with a large budget just to support the paid staff, which means they must constantly appeal for donations. The unfortunate consequence of that, is that they often compete for your attention, energy, and money, which as we will argue, immediately undermines the good they intend.
