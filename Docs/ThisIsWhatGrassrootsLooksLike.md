## Introduction <a name = "introduction" />
Events over the course of the last decade, and most dramatically 6 months, have shown just how vulnerable our political process has become. Principles we thought reliable are shifting under our feet and melting away like polar ice. Institutions we relied on to support economic stability, education, workers' rights, and environmental protection are perverted or dysfunctional. In short, national and often state governments tend to work against the interests of the people. And many people feel isolated and/or under siege. Generally things seem out of whack.

 Right now people are energized. They want to do something to promote their vision of a just society. It is obvious that neither of the two parties is capable of nurturing this kind of energy. In fact, they've fairly often proved themselves more a source of disillusionment.

And while the issue-focused national and state efforts such as ACLU and Planned Parenthood are important allies, they are not by themselves sufficient. The issues demanding engagement are too varied for any single group. More importantly they do not provide the necessary forum to organize and coordinate local responses.

Many are turning to coordinated volunteer groups such as those founded on the Indivisible Guide, and those inspired by Michael Moore's 5 things. These new efforts in fact continue the pattern of grassroots response modeled by Black Lives Matter among others.

But these most recent efforts lack much coordination and coherence.  Energy is dissipated by bad scheduling and contradictory messaging. How can they be sustainable unless they can effectively channel their energy.

What we need is a networked model for grassroots organizing. The basic unit is the home organization, a group that is small enough to truly reflect the interests of its members and to nurture leadership. The home organization must collaborate with other similar organizations to coordinate events, messaging, and to provide a larger talent pool.

The individual must have the tools to engage with a home institution but also to include other organizations, to be able to add events, add a news feed, and be able to track upcoming campaigns.

This document argues that volunteer-based, well networked grassroots organizations are our best chance for correcting the problems we face. It presents the capabilities we think are essential for success. It then goes on to sketch out the architecture, entity model and APIs to promote interoperability and optimal user control.

## What's keeping us down? <a name = "failures_of_top_down" />
Organizations which provided some support for progressives have not kept pace with cultural and structural changes in our country. In particular, the shift to online interaction has loosened civic bonds.
*   Trade unions have been weakened and are often not sufficiently representative
*   Religious institutions, taken as a whole, do not offer a coherent moral narrative
*   The traditional two parties will probably continue to dominate our electoral process, but they have largely failed to produce candidates who truly represent the interests of the people. In fact, the two party system consistently tends to impede rather than foster progressive change
*   Individuals no longer have a common fund of reliable, useful information. Important information is too often lost amidst the spinning and pontificating.

People are more isolated and find it harder to organize. they can and have used social media to mitigate the problem, but timelines and Facebook style groups tend to lack the full support people need.

In short, despite all the fanfare of netroots, the information age has left grassroots groups stranded. Of course there are blogs, web sites, and such, but there is no opportunity for inter-organizational collaboration.  The for the individual to organize resources are themselves scattered among many calendars, many URLs, and many messages in the inbox -- or spam folder. The signal-to-noise ratio is quite small.  So while the political parties and others controlling messaging have made abundant use of information analytics in support of their campaigns, the progressive grassroots world is still struggling.

The world has moved from static sites to dynamic, user-centered apps.  The work to develop these is often beyond the scope of groups that are largely volunteer-based.
