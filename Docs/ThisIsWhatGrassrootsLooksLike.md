## Introduction <a name = "introduction" />
Events over the course of the last decade and most dramatically over the last 6 months have shown just how vulnerable our democratic institutions have become. Principles we thought reliable are shifting under our feet and melting away like polar ice. Institutions we relied on to support economic stability, education, workers' rights, and environmental protection are perverted or dysfunctional. In short, national and often state governments tend to work against the interests of the people they are supposed to represent, leaving them to feel isolated and/or under siege. Things seem out of whack.

 Right now people are energized in resistance. They want to do something to promote their vision of a just society. It is obvious that neither of the two parties is capable of nurturing this kind of energy. In fact, they have fairly often proved themselves more of a hindrance

And while the issue-focused national and state efforts such as ACLU and Planned Parenthood are important allies, they are not by themselves sufficient. The issues demanding engagement are too varied for any single group. More importantly they do not provide the necessary forum to organize and coordinate local responses. They cannot replace the need for effective grass roots organizing.

Many are turning to coordinated volunteer groups such as those founded on the Indivisible Guide, and those inspired by Michael Moore's 5 things. These new efforts continue the pattern of grassroots response modeled by Black Lives Matter among others. But these most recent efforts lack much coordination and coherence.  Energy is dissipated by bad scheduling and contradictory messaging. How can they be sustainable unless they can effectively channel their energy.

What we need is a networked model for grassroots organizing.

The basic unit is the home organization, a group that is small enough to truly reflect the interests of its members and to nurture leadership. The home organization must collaborate with other similar organizations to coordinate messaging and events and to provide a larger talent pool.  The home organization serves as a forum for each member to engage. It must provide members with the ability to track events, to initiate actions and to contribute to ongoing efforts.

The individual activist must also have the tools to engage with other organizations according to specific interests: to be able aggregate events and news feed from those organizations and to track and participate in upcoming campaigns.

Finally, it should support the ability for home organizations to coordinate funding of larger efforts so that those efforts need not compete with grass roots but to draw from that energy.

This document argues that volunteer-based, well networked grassroots organizations are our best chance for correcting the problems we face. It presents the capabilities we think are essential for success. It then goes on to sketch out the architecture, entity model and APIs to promote interoperability and optimal user control.

In addition for arguing the case for well-networked grassroots organization, we explore capabilities needed and possible IT approaches to facilitating its growth.

## What's keeping us down? <a name = "failures_of_top_down" />
Progressive organizations have not kept pace with cultural and structural changes in our country. In particular, the shift to online interaction has loosened civic bonds.
*   Trade unions have been weakened and are often not sufficiently representative
*   Religious institutions, taken as a whole, do not offer a coherent moral narrative
*   The traditional two parties will probably continue to dominate our electoral process, but they have largely failed to produce candidates who truly represent the interests of the people. In fact, the two party system consistently tends to impede rather than foster progressive change
*   Individuals no longer have a common fund of reliable, useful information. Important information is too often lost amidst the spinning and pontificating.

Thus, grassroots groups promoting democratic change must fight in isolation with scarce resources against fabulously well-endowed superPACs and national parties. At the risk of oversimplification, the grass roots is in a battle with the oligarchy for the soul of the country.

The internet is less open these days, but it still offers a solution, and grass roots groups have yet to make good use of it.

Despite all the talk of netroots, modern web capabilities have left grassroots groups stranded. Resistance movements are working with Google groups, small sites and independently maintained email lists. These are useful but insufficient. They lack any real infrastructure for inter-organizational collaboration, and facilities available for the individual to assemble resources are themselves scattered among many calendars, many URLs, and many messages in the inbox. The signal-to-noise ratio is quite small.

The world has moved on to dynamic, user-centered, mobile-friendly apps.  The work to develop these is often beyond the scope of groups that are largely volunteer-base. This leaves grass roots organizations disadvantaged. They must either pony up for hosted capabilities or rely on donated IT time, the latter tending to lead to one-off, poorly maintained solutions.

Further there is the issue of big data analytics, which the oligarchy has effectively deployed for their own purposes. That capability -- to use it for our own purposes -- is out of the reach of most grass roots efforts.

Finally, we are still suffering under the fallacy of scarce resources. It is wrong for progressive groups to compete for email addresses and dollars. Doing so undermines grass roots activism. Rather than competing, groups should be working toward mutual support.

*   Tuesday: Knock, knock, knock. _Do you care about clean lakes? Sign the petition to address pesticide runoff. Could you please donate $20, $50, $80 to save the Lakes?_
*   Wednesday: Knock, knock, knock: _Do you care about the honeybees? Sign the petition to control the use of these chemicals. Could you please donate $20, $50, $80 to save the bees?_

Many people care about both of these things along with a host of others, but have little to give and want to plan their gifts as well as their engagements carefully.  This kind of thing is adequate at best only as a last resort and when the population is passive and unorganized. But in the current environment, people are desperate to organize, desperate to engage more fully, desperate to have their energy (including money) put to effective use. How can signing those petitions and being deluged with more hectoring email help us take meaningful action?

 What is worse, some national groups will not share information with their state and local chapters. If a person joins a national progressive group, she would logically assume to participate in local events of that chapter. But, surprisingly, that may not be the case. At least one national group will not release its membership roles to the local, even on an opt-in basis.

 This is a failed model.

## The unrealized power of the grassroots network <a name = "grassroots_network" />
People have risen in protest many times over the last decade in response to attacks on people's safety and well-being. the Black Lives Matter movements and The Wisconsin resistance movements of 2011 are two such.  Many have proven effective for at least a while, some are still active, all have left a legacy of possibilities. Now, at least for a while, the call to resistance is massive.

People are mobilized again.  Now they need to organize building on what we've learned so far.
